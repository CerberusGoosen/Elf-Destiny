# Priority: Urgent
- FIX Elven Superiority renown!

- Straighten out the head of faith thing

mututally exclusive tier 4 geentic traits

tribal asecenion cant build feudal holdings

- check out heroic courage
    - does it work how it is
    - we should just add single combat

tier 4 genetics are mututally exclusive with tier 3

# Priority: Important

- elf blood aastru/norse, stuck in matchmaking request loop. couldnt get further than allowing them to find a match for player.
- familial familarity may not be allowing family marriage
- The event for choosing a marriage candidate doesn't work if you haven't done the expedition or are an elf, as it doesn't generate anyone or give any options to the player. So if you were to convert to Aeluran Weavers the event fires repeatedly but nothing ever happens.

# Priority: Mid
- "Host A Expedition" localization fix
- Tribal Ascension: you'll turn into a theocracy and get a game over. This happens once you turn your tribal lands feudal.
- True Elf and higher tiers donÂ´t have a "years_of_fertility" bonus like the lower tiers?
- Aeluran Advisor fineshes the "Undermine" task without results.
- people who already have elf culture/religion run into weirdness when they convert in main quest
- Aeluran advisor may be causing some real relam preist asignment problems, check issues comment for more

# Priority: low
- divinic_empowerment is still used or listed somewhere
