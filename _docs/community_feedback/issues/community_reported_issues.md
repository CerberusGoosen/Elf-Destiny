<!-- "Host a expedition" should be "Host an expedition" -->

<!-- So I Just Tried It Out, And every time I take the expeditions activity I get there it just keeps popping up with there is an elven riddle, it happens about two more times on max funds and then I go home with nothing. -->

<!-- The non-Aeluren elven faith only has two tenets in the game. In the "spark_religion" file, a third tenet "divinic_empowerment" is listed, but no such tenet is found in the "core_tenets" file. -->

<!-- If you decide to pick the "advanced tribal government" civic, you'll turn into a theocracy and get a game over. This happens once you turn your tribal lands feudal. -->

<!-- Bug: can't wear the "Sigil of the Realm Lord" artifact. -->

<!-- Browsing through the files a bit more... is it intentional that that True Elf and higher tiers donÂ´t have a "years_of_fertility" bonus like the lower tiers? -->

<!-- Aeluran Advisor fineshes the "Undermine" task without results. -->

<!-- for some reason the expedition always came out as sealed door stone and must solve it to proceed, has been repeated for several expedition now -->

<!-- The culture civic that allows you to have farms in forest and taiga doesnt work -->

<!-- Something else I just noticed: After I select "Elven Superiority", I get 0.50 Renown for each of my family members. However, I suspect there should only be 0.50 Renown for me as the head? With currently 170 family members, that's a lot of what I get. -->

<!-- Interesting mod.
However, at the first events I was unable to accept the culture or religion of the elves.
I guess it has to do with the fact that I've adapted both my culture and my religion before.
In both cases, the name of the new culture is an empty string in the description.
When I start a new game the conversions work.

The other culture adjustments you can get through the following events are added to my current culture, I just don't know how to adjust the religion. -->

<!-- The Familial Familiarity tradition also doesn't work, well at least the allowing familial marriage part still don't know about getting the purer blood. -->

<!-- Played an Asatru Norse Jarl in Denmark, self created with Elf Blood trait, converted to Aeluran faith, wasn't married. The Weavers Sisters talked to me about finding a waifu 4 times, but it never went any further than me allowing them to find one for me. Is there another condition or was this a bug? -->

<!-- me: lol those <insert name> tags are hard coded in, Ive been too lazy to replace them with working parameters -->

<!-- the elf culture trait that adds in farms for forest and taiga just doesnt work for me -->

<!-- The Undermine action with the priest doesn't work I am afraid. I never got a weak claim. I figured it was chance based like in ck2, but even with a 40 learning person and multiple years it never happened.

Also, there is a bug with the realm priests. When you first become an elf you can see that the game recalculates everyone realm priest I fear and it keeps doing that infinitely. Best way to reproduce is playing under Italy in 867, when you become an Elf take a look at Novara. The poor bishop there has a schizophrenic attack as he keeps becoming the Realm Priest than removed over and over... at every tick. -->

Cursed:
<!-- A niggling issue I'm having is that my Heir is also my concubine. But I keep getting pop-ups from the Aeluran Sisterhood, saying she needs to be married. Minor but irritating. -->

<!-- Do you have any intention of making it compatible with the inverted genders game rule? -->
