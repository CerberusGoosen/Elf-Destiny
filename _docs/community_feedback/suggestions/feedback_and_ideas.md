<!-- 
So I could not resist curiosity and try it. My thoughts:

Really good for just , in your words Beta. I can see how much work you put in it. Unlike others , other that glichy elf ears I had no problems.

Like stated in comments some traits are overly OP for just low level elf , but I sas you plan 10 lvl-system , so I am already happy. Take your time with it and it will be great.

Now just some my ideas :

Traditon Tiering - most likely Bronze - Silver - Gold. example : Animal taming - Bronze / unlock Wolf riders Tradition- that unlock many Man-at-arms or special /Gold

Elves should have highter movement speed and dev bonus in woods.

Elven royalty can be distinguished by the Symbol or Tattoo on their forehead

Man-at-arms ideas :

Stag riders (heavy horse archers) , changing Wolf riders to Light cavalery

Bear or Lion riders (heavy cavalery) - yes there were lions in Europe.

Elven vanguard - skirmishers - double elven scimitar

Elven spearmen legion - basically Hobbit

Elven Silver Guard - Heavy infantry - 50/regiment - elven royal guard composed of Semi-titans

Elven Griffith Riders - Heavy Cavalery - 50/regiment - griffons without wings - mountain/hills bonuses

Buildings :

Elven woodcrafters - give money , dev growth , constructon time

Elven smiths - ironwood evolves into steelwood at 5 / gives regiment defence - attack , army maintenace , dev growth , money

Elven groows - fertile Lands under elven care - atrittion limit , money , levies

Duchy building : Three of life - gives Prestige , Dev growth , dynasty points , money -->


<!-- The House looked OP. Generally with modded traits my impression is everything would be more balanced if they just cut whatever they wanted to do in half. Especially when your game heavily promotes the eugenics game you can assume there are a lot of other positive traits that are going to be passed down and reinforced so just try to limit them. Don’t get me wrong though. The eugenics game is absolutely a big part of the CK3 gameplay loop and this looks like a fun addition to me.

Side note I did like how you included the rationale for the disadvantage in the description. Martial is meant to represent strategic competence though, which requires intelligence. Maybe make it -2 martial? Also sluggish isn’t exactly ideal for a warrior so maybe make it that they tire easier? I think what you are saying is that they are basically like a weight lifter who is very strong but not exactly Olympic running material. Not sure best way to phrase that though.

Also I wouldn’t be surprised if you get hate for the art because it’s AI but honestly looks good. Gives the mod a very attractive/professional feel. -->

<!-- Just an idea for truer gameplay but maybe lower the life expectancy and the inbreed chance cause those 2 are pretty op ngl -->

<!-- I actually unironically really enjoy mildly overpowered buffs like this. I haven't read anything more to see if there's negatives involved but if there's not (or not enough in your opinion) and you're looking to add some I'd recommend like a negative opinion modifier towards and from non-elves. 

Ok, now having read a bit, a recommendation (that I have no idea about in terms of coding or balance or anything), for the artificial increase in elf tiers since you said you wanted to make it harder. Perhaps large amounts of piety and prestige combined with the need for a lot of learning or stewardship and have it lead down a storyline where you trace back your lineage and/or read ancient elven texts that detail elves of old learning to unlock greater powers. You could make it a personal scheme if you want and make it trigger events like a romance scheme. But also have it so if you fail it's cheaper piety/prestige wise to retry the scheme, make a higher learning make it go easier, if there's an old elvish language in the mod make knowing the language make the scheme go easier, that sorta thing. -->

<!-- My biggest issue is the Old Age Prowess modifier and Infirm trait. Maybe not remove them but change at what age they kick in relative to the elf trait we got? Like instead of 50 we get it around 80? -->

<!-- I also noticed you can get money from expeditions but I don't know how to consistently do that. Maybe add Expedition intents like "Discover" and relearn our traditions or "Raid/Loot" to find trinkets/gold/artifacts? A hostile obstacle would also seem like a nice addition. Maybe there's a trapped room we have to solve/sacrifice an expedition member or we found a guardian and we have to duel them. Maybe this could be used to level up the Aeluran respect part? Still don't know how to get that. -->

<!-- The Familial Familiarity tradition also doesn't work, well at least the allowing familial marriage part still don't know about getting the purer blood. -->

<!-- I have a suggestion regarding the rituals. How about, instead of Piety cost, it required you to sacrtifice some rare artifacts you would get from the expeditions? As it stands without a way to generate piety in an immersive way it is simply a waiting game. -->

<!-- I think more expedition locations might be needed -->

<!-- Hey. My suggestion would be to either make the portal items equipable or make them court items. It's confusing to not be able to equip the sigil of the realm lord since it doesn't state a reason why it's not equipable. -->

<!-- A tradition/tenet for abdication would be really nice so you don't get to far removed from your descendants when arranging marriages. The eugenics game gets annoying when you're dealing with your great grandchildren. Maybe something about going through the portal and not coming back? -->

<!-- For two subjective things, the name elite archer knight is super awkward and wolf rider sounds more like light cavalry to me. Something like Fey Marksmen and Dire wolf/Warg Riders/Knights might be better names.

Also when you get to pick a new tradition, it would make things a bit more clear if you grayed out the options you already have and gave a fifth option to choose nothing in case you have them all. -->

<!-- The advanced tribal goverment can use some explanation, it allows you to feudalize the holding? but keep raiding? Is that how it is supposed to work? -->

<!-- After reforming the Aeluran faith into spiritual HOF (which is somehow set as temporal HOF by default), the HOF is just regular human, the HOF should only be High Matriach elves imo as she's supposed to be the undisputed leader of the Aelurans, also why is the faith's view on gender male dominated yet male adultery is criminal while female adultery is accepted? On the same note, seeing that the existing ruler elves are both male (in Mongolia) and female (in Volga Ural) and the faith leader is exclusively female by default (matron) meant that it's supposed to be at least Equal. -->

<!-- Also if you picked Elven Superiority, the faith shouldn't be pluralist to reflect the superiority part, maybe also make it so only elves may become a ruler and be an eligible marriage candidate (-1000 for non elves for example, and incremental negative point for each stage of lower elf purity stage difference), while Open Hearted should mean that they won't be resorting to incest (no divine marriage tenet) for the sake of staying away from the impure blooded humans. With that I think it's best to make 2 different cultures of the Elf heritage and 2 different faith within the Divine Spark religion which brings 2 different playstyle. -->

<!-- The ascended tribe government is basically just feudal that can raid afaik, maybe you can repurpose and modify the the existing "practiced pirates" tradition and keep it vanilla feudal until you can add more features to make the new government even more unique. -->

<!-- I know the mod isn't aiming for balance but the renown bonus from elven superiority is insane. Every member of your dynasty contributes as much as an independent duke. The vanilla cap for unlanded dynasty members is 2 renown a month. You hit that with 4 elves in your family.

Also the faith also has pure blood but not purer blood or purest blood as virtues, which seems like an oversight. -->

<!-- also pure blood isn't mutually exclusive with purer or purest of blood -->


<!-- ME: im flexible on the portal location... havent really decided what to do with it. I put it with the aelurans for now and It makes sense lore wise that its up in the great forests of the north where "the elves live"
I could make a special event where you hire a team to move the pieces to your realm's capital
maybe it costs a shit ton of gold to do -->


<!-- The lore and mechanics are really interesting. The only thing I have to suggest is that if you become an Elf the way I did and adopt elvish culture, it should get all of the innovations of your current culture. The "technology" of my playthrough just lost over a century of progress. Other than that, fantastic mod! -->


<!-- "Can you add a game rule so that there are no ruling elves at the start of either start date?" -->
