# Beta_v1.5.7

- Elf Finder reset button now resets all the bottom filter buttons too.
- Shifted Elf Finder button a bit to the left to avoid collision with the "Search And Trade Artifacts" mod.
- Now only the father of an unborn baby can ask an Aeluran Sister to change the baby's gender.
- Some characters had an invisible trait slot in their character window. Should be fixed now.
- Fixed a bug where Non-Aeluran regencies would not be able to change their regency mandates.
- Revisited how we are handling characters spawned without a race. Now it should be much more performant AND consistent!
- The Toggle Nudity/Change Appearance buttons in Ruler Designer should be properly placed now!
- fixed bug with regency mandate county control event
