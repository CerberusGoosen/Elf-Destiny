# Beta_v1.5.22

NEW! Aeluran Authority Laws and UI

# Other Fixes
- Drain Beauty Chracter Interaction from Nefertiti's Armband should now work outside of Debug mode
- Fixed alternative beauty traits spawn chances and possible double beauty trait assignment
- Aeluran vassals should stay Aeluran Order government when gifted additional titles.
- Fixed bug with Aeluran Vassal Magi Contribution, should be receiving more now.
- Humans shouldnt get a vote in Elf Elective any longer.
- When reforming the Aeluran Religion, the High Matriarch will now remain the head of faith.
- Marked Advanced Tribal as being a tribal government for other game checks such as "Government uses prestige to buy troops". Will keep an eye on this for new issues, I think there was a reason it wasn't added already.
- A variety of localization and other minor cleanups
