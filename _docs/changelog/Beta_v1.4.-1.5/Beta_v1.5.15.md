# Beta_v1.5.15

## Entrance Scheme - Upgrade
- Now functions again with the new DLC!
- Now considers sexual orientation in success chance
- Now considers attraction level in success chance
- Now considers lover/soulmate/rival/nemesis relationships in success chance
- Added more accurate "success odds" to the Scheme UI
- Bug Fix: Failing the first "Planting the seed" check will actually fail the scheme now and you will be booted from the feast


## Misc/Bug Fixes
- Upgrade - Ruler Designer: Race Selection
    - Should work much better for multi-player! Now players should be able to choose different races from each other.
        - Note: There will likely still be some UI issues with ears and icons in the ruler designer/lobby but it should all sort itself out once the game starts.
        - Second Note: I never play multiplayer so if you do and its still not working, let me know 
    - Should save choice for each ruler designed before game start, so now players can customize multiple starting elf rulers.

- Cheat Menu Race Selection: Changing a character to an Elf should no longer cause all of their children to be Aratar Gods

- Updated mod to use the new base game hair color palette, now with its vibrant red hair colors.
