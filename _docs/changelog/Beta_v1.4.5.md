# Beta_v1.4.5

Tinkered with some of the Artifacts 
- adjusted bonus modifiers
- fixed rarity/bonus mismatch (need to test)

Fixed broken Vizier functionality

Aeluran Matching Making 
 - offering already married women
 - "Wants my daughter to marry herself" https://discord.com/channels/1179053540161880074/1225101355606343735
 - can marry self
 - heir text is wrong


## Polish Ideas

- make new Aeluran event header?
- The matches may have too generous of genetic traits currently and may need a slight nerf
- can we use the event window from grand activities? try!
    - if need be, find the ui component that launches an activity and copy it into custom event widget or something

 Ideas for new match candidates
 - Wise women/man, maybe with Gardner/Herbalist, maybe a doctor
 - lame but offers you a dowry
 - renowned tribal warrior (strong/blademaster/etc)
 - a rare chance to be offered a possessed lunatic albino, with Arbitrary,Fickle,Eccentric (maybe with an unusually high elf trait level to make it tempting)
 - match with claim to neighbors lands?
 - maybe a VERY rare chance at newly generated bloodline characters
    - make each have archetypical traits that emphasize those bloodlines
    - NOTE: I believe this may already be a thing but is either inactive code or gated behind something
 - elf of distant land, they have aeluran religion but random ethnicity/culture
   - has traveler/adventurer traits
 - aeluran Matriarch
   - children give born into the red trait (secret from character creation)

   NEW AELURAN GOVERNMENT TYPE!
      - primary holding church
      - please thoroughly review _governments.info options
      - may need to make tribal church holdings a thing

   MAY NEED TO IMPLEMENT AELURAN RESPECT SCORE NOW!!!
      - literally copy everything about legitamacy! UI and currency!
      at high respect levels aeluran adviser starts down path of best friend with ruler instead of tyrant 

   NEED NEW VASSAL CONTRACT!

   Maybe giving in to aelurans grants 
   - stress loss
   - fertility
   - better genetic chance
   - cheaper ascension and blessing cost!

   events:
   - SHAME naked walk througn capital, maybe for vassals too


# REGENCY NOTES

- genderlaw seems to matter!
- still need to figure out why adviser and regent are mutually exclusive! 

- Regent is a council position SO it is mutually exclusive with all other counciler positions!
   - maybe we can see if this logic is set somewhere and not hard coded

- visier is a cover over spouse
   - it sets viser, then removes spouse
- YET it STILL exisits at same time as Regent! More investigation needed


##### ACTION PLAN
- wonderful, the gui should be good now
- make aeluran adviser IDENTICAL to vizier and see if we can get it to populate at same time as regeny
   - Aeluran regency must also be identical to vizier one!

NOTE: we may need to alter the council gui again to be identical to vizier

THEN once (if) we have it working
- start adding back features until it either works or breaks to identify the issue!




Should implement twins/triplets/quad/etc naming on twins perk
aeluran adviser should offer herself!

donate crystal to the order to recieve the very best matching services,
like "show me only giant, or beautiful"
also just a better percentasge chance at rarer traits!!
really look to other existing activities to explore all features like bars and other widgets
respect effects matches


NEW Character Interactions:
if you have open extra slots, request matchmaking
for any children without matches, character interaction to request matchmaking
