# Beta_v1.4.5

CONSIDER RECORDING A VIDEO DEV DIARY FOR THIS PATCH DEMONSTARTING NEW FETAURES!!!!
- make youtube number go up

maybe upload both a complete patch review video and sub-segments to youtube separately so you can share segments on redditt

### IN DEV DIARY explain that although your advisor will do these things like matchmaking, they are currently AI only. I will one day make Aeluran Advisor a 100% playable role

## Should We create Aleuran Inquisitor Discord role now?

Tinkered with some of the Artifacts 
- adjusted bonus modifiers
- fixed rarity/bonus mismatch (need to test)

Expedition party now also gains spark manipulation novice on transformation

Fixed permanent children bug from Ascensions

Fixed broken Vizier functionality

Acended Tribal should now have access to feudal tax and levy contracts

Took yet another stab at fixing the elf blood child bug

Purer/Purest Blooded inheritance got a little easier thanks to @Slertd
Daughters sent to be trained by the aelurans return a bit earlier to avoid some edge case bugs thanks to @Slertd
If you havent moved the portal, now offered to move capital there when the portal is restored thanks to @Robmart | Northpointed

Aeluran Matching Making 
 - offering already married women
 - "Wants my daughter to marry herself" https://discord.com/channels/1179053540161880074/1225101355606343735
 - can marry self
 - heir text is wrong

# TODOS to not forget
- when you choose to take the aeluran faith or reform the faith, make sure all the appropriate people change too
- EXTERNAL: Atlantis compat suggestion (see chat)
- EXTERNAL GIthub pureblood PR
- Invite to expedition character interaction: huge win
- fill out events descs for matron/matriarch selection/ and also "give aeluran adviser holding" events
- maybe add another special cycle in the aeluran story to have a battle of wills for the aelurans to seize a county
- maybe add a few more story characters
- put back legitmacy ui panel experiment

- regency mandates should not work on aeluran vassals

## Tasks
- flush out aeluran government
- matchmaking: "request for child" character interaction
- matchmaking: finish intro quality score widget
- regency: balance respect score swing values
- regency: battle of wills interaction

matchmaking for ai
finish battle of wills
finish aeluran reinforcement event/game concept
finish aeluran units
add remaining items to respect score
only spark talented daughters get sent to school
   - test
FINISH: multi-birth naming event
   - test that your version of birth events are triggering. Seems vanilla is triggering until you save the mod's file

## Polish Ideas

enable matchmaking for AI, it can be handled differently but send a message if players children are chosen, penalities for refusing

the build new church holding for advisor still is selecting vassals owned counties

the red sister and aeluran adviser need game concept tool tips like vassal does in the character profile UI

aeluran advisor should offer herself!

NEW Character Interactions:
if you have open extra slots, request matchmaking

# Aeluran Respect

maybe "domination" is the regent scale checkpoints but respect is what shifts it to those checkpoints

if cant control of reference current scale value
- we cant check flags set at each balance of power mile stone
OR
- we can manage respect seperate from the scales and then change balance to that value
