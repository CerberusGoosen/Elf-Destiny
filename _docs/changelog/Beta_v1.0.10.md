# Beta_v1.0.10

Traditions
- Heroic Courage:
  - It actually works now!
  - Heroic Personality is no longer part of the general personality trait pool so random people wont just have it.
  <!-- - Kills gotten through duels now count towards the unlock. -->
- Tribal Ascension
  - feudal holdings are now build-able
- Fey Agoras
  - effect now should apply to courtiers as well

GUI
- fixed liege council for when they dont have an Aeluran Advisor

<!-- Gold Tutorial indicators -->

Evolved Traits
- added to genetic groups, hopefully solves some random bugs
  - NOTE TO ME: Just redo them to use "potential"?
