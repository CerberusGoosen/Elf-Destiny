# Beta_v1.5.17
The Elf cultures now have different cloth selections and cultural ethos instead of all being the same! (Thx Markus)

## Bugs
Added a hard fix for occasional ageless adult babies (Thx Robmart)
Localization fix
Empty council notification no longer pops up for landless adventurers
Fixed broken tooltips on Regency GUI windows
Fixed nasty issue where conquering a neighboring Feudal/Tribal/Admin county as Advanced Tribal would convert you to that new government type automatically.
