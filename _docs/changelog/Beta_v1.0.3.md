# Beta_v1.0.2

- Expedition Trials being triggered should be more consistent. (One trial per expedition, not repeat spammed).
    - There may still be an issue with the tutorial trial people are having do to a mod conflict. If you see that come report it and provide your debug/error logs when it happens! (and mod list plz)
