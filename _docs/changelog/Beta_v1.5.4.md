# Beta_v1.5.4

Bug Fix: When being offered an Aeluran Sister in the matchmaking event, there was a chance you might be offered yourself.

Succession Types

Elf Inheritance Succession:
    - Child is still chosen but most worthy child

Elf Inheritance Succession Elective:
    - heirs are candidates but must be voted for
    - elf vassals get votes
    - aeluran adviser gets extra vote!!!
    - player gets extra votes

Alt version where instead the best elf in the realm is chosen period

maybe overwrite yearly_health_pulse to stop old elves from becoming infirm

Julia needs to be added to the generate kids exemption list
- big fix: now shouldnt show up to first expedition dead

SPANISH!

## Religious Resistance
- I THINK ive made it so AI Aeluran Order members wont choose to convert to a non-elf faith automatically by themselves.
- Members of the Aeluran Order cant be forced to convert by Human Rulers

now upon creating a new Aeluran faith, most Aeluran order members will convert with you.
- Matriarch (100% of the time)
- Matrons (75% of the time)
- Sisters (90% of the time)


# New Cultures
new elf starter cultures! One for each ruling bloodline
<list them>

Now elf cultures will have a mix of red/black/brown/blond hair instead of just blond. Each culture has a different ratio.
