# Beta_v1.5.4


# NEW! Succesion Type - Elf Elective
- Similar to feudal Elective but wit a focus on selecting the most powerful elf.
- Aelurans will expect Elf rulers to adopt this Elective type and will gain more votes if you have low control!

# Misc
Julia Melwood:
- hopefully wont have random children on game start
- now shouldnt show up to first expedition dead

Updated SPANISH Localization added, thanks @kordih!

Elves SHOULD no longer become infirm or incapable from old age alone!

Bug Fix: When being offered an Aeluran Sister in the matchmaking event, there was a chance you might be offered yourself.

## Religious Alignments
- I THINK now AI Aeluran Order members wont choose to convert to a non-elf faith automatically by themselves.
- Members of the Aeluran Order cant be forced to convert by Human Rulers

Now upon creating a new Aeluran faith, most Aeluran order members will convert with you.
- Matriarch (100% of the time)
- Matrons (75% of the time)
- Sisters (90% of the time)

- removed the Aelruan Order vassals shift in loyalty mechanic from Aeluran diarchies 

# NEW! Alternate Elf Cultures
new elf starter cultures! One for each ruling bloodline
- Tuatha Dé Danann
- Álfar
- Romaviri
- Astrion
- Deepwood Elven

Now elf cultures will have a mix of red/black/brown/blond hair instead of just blond. Each culture has a different ratio.
