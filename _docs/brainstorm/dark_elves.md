## Blood Magic

_Human Sacrifice_
maybe should be in religious tenets 
it might:
    - Give more piety then other sacrifices
    - used with Ascension! Allows you to have additional characters join you
        - if you sacrifice someone close you get a chance at double Ascension
            - actually display this! as an additional +x%
    - used with pregnancy to increase odds of getting favorable traits or ascending in the womb!
    - used to catch a glimpse of the future
        - might be evolved lifestyle from Oracle
 
_Memory Reading_
- Reveals all known secrets, used on prisoners who courtiers who submit. Maybe you can order it with a chance for them to refuse. Act of tyranny if you then arrest them.

_Reaving_
- every enemy you personally defeat in combat gives you a boost, maybe a 5 stage trait to track power gain
    - this could be a good time to introduce empowered, that way there could be a bloodmage version "blood knight"

_Rejuvenation_
- heal injuries
- make younger
- this could be a new lifestyle
    - would then need to introduce "healer" as well

## Traditions

_Blood Oaths_

**Oath Of Fealty**
Vassals may swear a blood oath, this will prevent them from ever rebelling
    - another dog icon
    - maybe way to have it transfer to your bloodline.

**Oath Of Servitude**
- stronger dog icon
    - characters will refuse by default
        - maybe requires strong hook or torture
    - a more powerful version that can combine with the sacrifice tenet to bind a whole dynasty

**Oath Of Final Resolution**
    - If a loved one is murdered or even just rivals and nemeses
    - you have 10 years to murder them and gain boosts to help, if you fail you die.

_Mutation Pits_
- evolves the beast tamers tradition and provides additional MAA
    - made from experiments with Wyrms
    - lesser wyvern
        - Hydra
        - Greater Serpents
            - Basilisk Variant
                - Even where if serelion you get a greater basilisk egg and go through an event chain that ultimately ends with a massive 1/1 unit.
