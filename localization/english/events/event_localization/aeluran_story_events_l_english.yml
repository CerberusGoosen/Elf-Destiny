  aeluran_story.002.desc:0 "You enter your council chambers to find the Aeluran Sisters waiting. They are two women in red, both with an ageless beauty. One of the women steps forward.\n\n\"M'[ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord] my name is [aeluran_matron.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]. You have the privilege of standing before Mistress [high_matriarch.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], High Matriarch of the Aeluran Weavers.\" \n\n At this introduction, the other women steps forward. She moves with an effortless grace, her face ageless and wise.\n\n \"My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], I know our arrival is unexpected but we come to discuss a matter most important. I felt the release of divine energy, and finding you an Elf in Human lands confirms it. I know you have found the Sigil of the Realm Lord\" "

  aeluran_story.003.desc:0 "I am not here to take it from you. The Sigil only reacts to those it finds worthy. Possessing it marks you as the undisputed Elf Lord of this world. In ancient times Elves and Humans came to this world through a great portal. Countless empires have risen and fallen since. At one point the very Elf emperor whom's tomb you found the sigil, was overthrown in a massive rebellion. \n\nMost Elves of the world were either slain or fled back through the portal leaving this world behind. A small population did remain, sticking to the far wilds where they could live in peace. After the great exodus, important components of the portal were destroyed by the rebels and our gateway to the other realms was lost. \n\nMy [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], the sigil choosing you and at this time is no coincidence. It is confirmation that the Divine Spark, the great creator of all things, is making its will known. It is time to restore the Grand Portal and welcome the great Elf peoples back to this world!"
  aeluran_story.003.ok:0 "A momentous and worthy undertaking!"

  aeluran_story.004.desc:0 "It is indeed! You will need to find replacements for the destroyed portal components. Ive learned such things were rare yet still available in the days of old. You must continue your expeditions of ancient Elven sites and find the parts we need. We have brought maps with us, they detail some new elf ruins for you to investigate. The worlds fate is in your hands.\n\nBefore we make the long journey back to our sanctum in the North I have one additional matter to discuss with you. \n\nIt is customary of all Elven Lords across all realms to accept the Divine Spark as the true guiding force of the universe. Furthermore the Sisters of The Aeluran Weavers are seen as the shepherds of its will. I implore you to accept the Order into your lands, to advise and further the interests of the Divine Spark"
