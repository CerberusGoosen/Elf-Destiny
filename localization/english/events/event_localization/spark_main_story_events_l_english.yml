His eyes narrow slightly, doubt clear on his face. You think you can hear him mumbling \"... not a real title\" \n\n\"I strive to discover clues our ancestors left behind and my specialty is the study of the mysterious ancient Elf people. Very little is known about them as finding any of their artifacts is exceedingly rare. What has been found tells us that they were highly advanced maybe even more so than ourselves and that they were around for many hundreds or even thousands of years.\"\n\nRecently I came upon this map. Its covered in elven script I cant decipher, but it appears to show an old fortress high in the Alpine mountains.\" \n\nOpportunities to study the elves are once in a lifetime and if the fortress does exist it may have great treasures forgotten to time. \n\nI would like to mount an expedition to investigate these ruins, but I am in need of funding to supply such a journey. Will you help me?\"
