  wolf_invader.001.desc:0 "As you enter your council hall one of your councillors informs you of a strange occurrence near the portal gate.\n#BOL "My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], it seems that something or someone has caused significant disruption to the portal gate."#!\nAnother councillor offers their opinion.\n#BOL "No doubt it was some unruly children."#!\nOf course, it wouldn’t be a council meeting without your Aeluran advisor barging into the conversation.\n#BOL "My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], children cannot cause such destruction! Besides, this is sacrilege!"#! she says, her voice firm and authoritative.\n#BOL "As Realm [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|U], it is your duty to protect such a sacred place, one that connects our worlds together!\"#!\n\nAfter pondering for a moment, you decide to visit the portal and see what happened. Upon arrival, you find the area in a terrible state—trees uprooted, shrines destroyed, and fences torn apart. Large claw marks and tufts of heavy fur litter the ground. Whatever caused this damage is either a madman or vicious beast. Whatever this creature is, it must be stopped.

From a children’s story? What’s next? Giants?"#!\nOf course, this does not go unchallenged.\n"#BOL And I suppose you have a better idea of what could cause such a mess!?#!"\nThe countryside has been terrorized in the last few days—dead animals torn to shreds, people disappearing, strange and large claw marks, the same as the ones near the portal gate. It all makes sense. But why would a direwolf come here of all places? What does it seek here?"
  wolf_invader.002.a:0 "Spread the word, there's a direwolf running around."

  wolf_invader.003.title:0 "Destruction with No End"
  wolf_invader.003.desc:0 "Caravans, patrols, and merchants have all become targets of this direwolf, which preys on its in the darkness, killing and devouring anyone foolish enough to travel in small groups. It even destroyed a local whorehouse! Needless to say, this is severely affecting our economy—less trade and reduced tax revenue. The direwolf is causing chaos and must be dealt with. Your council begins to offer suggestions.\n#BOL "It should be hunted down and defeated!

  wolf_invader.0031.desc:0 "The castle is alive with activity, as would-be direwolf slayers have gathered with the intent to kill the beast, claim their payment, and earn glory. People from all walks of life have assembled in your courtyard—young men, men-at-arms, experienced killers, sellswords, thugs, and even a pirate among them. Whoever you choose to hire will face the difficult task of tracking down and killing this vicious, deadly creature."

  wolf_invader.0032.desc:0 "Rumors and gossip ripple through the castle: the mercenaries you hired have ridden through the gates, hauling a thick, bulky sack stained with blood atop a creaking cart. As they stride into the throne room, their prize in tow, you regard them with keen, pleasant curiosity.\n'It’s done, my [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|U],' the lead mercenary declares. 'The vile beast is dead.' With a flourish, he yanks the cover aside, revealing the grotesquely large head of the direwolf—mangled, bloody, and a grim spectacle to behold. Its doubtful a trophy could be recovered from the corpse.\n\nIn celebration, you host a grand feast. The hall echoes with laughter, clinking goblets, and toasts raised to the bravery of these rough-hewn men.\n\nYet as the mercenaries depart, a question lingers in your mind: what drove this creature to haunt your lands? What was its purpose? Perhaps the answer will forever elude you."

  wolf_invader.0033.desc:0 "It seems the mercenaries you hired were no match for the direwolf. Your councillor approaches, his face grim, and reports that the local peasants stumbled upon the sellswords’ mangled remains—torn apart and half-eaten. The creature still roams free, its howls haunting the countryside. Emboldened by this bloodshed, the direwolf grows ever more unpredictable, and none can say what terror it will unleash next."

  wolf_invader.004.title:0 "Wolf Slayer"
  wolf_invader.004.desc:0 "Your inaction against the direwolf has not sat well with the folk of your county. Whispers of discontent grew into action as some, desperate to end the beast’s reign, took matters into their own hands. Many ventured forth, and many met gruesome ends—yet one prevailed where all others faltered.\n\n[wolfslayer.GetFirstName] stands before you, the severed head of the creature in hand. It’s smaller than you imagined, far less fearsome than the wild tales had painted it. Still, who can say what a direwolf’s true measure should be? The beast is dead, its terror ended, and your lands breathe easier for it."

  wolf_invader.0041.desc:0 "You knew it all along! A gnawing suspicion told you [wolfslayer.GetFirstName] hadn’t truly slain the direwolf—and now the cursed beast has returned, its shadow once more darkening the countryside. Peasants cower behind bolted doors, their fields untended, while trade dwindles with each passing day. The truth is undeniable: this menace can no longer be ignored. It must be dealt with, once and for all."
  wolf_invader.0041.a:0 "I'm going to kill this damn creature myself!"
  wolf_invader.0041.b:0 "We have gold, let's pay someone to deal with this"

  wolf_invader.005.title:0 "Out Hunting"
  wolf_invader.005.desc:0 "I've gathered a skilled party of hunters and warriors to join me on the hunt. Our group is small enough to lure out the direwolf, yet strong enough to face the beast in combat. Over the next few days, we’ll scour the woods and wilderness—no matter where it hides, that vile creature won’t escape us!"
  wolf_invader.005.a:0 "Kill the beast!"

  wolf_invader.006.title:0 "Standoff"
  wolf_invader.006.desc:0 "You’ve been out here for days, tirelessly searching for the direwolf, but to no avail. Perhaps it’s fled your lands? Exhausted, you decide to take a break from the hunt and set up a small campfire—nothing too large, so as not to draw unwanted attention. As you rest, a sudden noise catches your ear. You turn to face it, but nothing meets your gaze. Then, a low growl rumbles through the air. It’s here, lurking in the shadows, watching, waiting for you to falter.\n\nMoments later, the beast reveals itself. You and your party lock eyes with it, each side poised, daring the other to strike first."
  wolf_invader.006.a:0 "Prepare to strike!"
  
  wolf_invader.0061.title:0 "Swing and a Miss"
  wolf_invader.0061.desc:0 "You charge at the direwolf, eager to strike, but before your blow can land, it bolts, vanishing deep into the forest. Your party erupts in cheers, yet you silence them with a glare, knowing victory is far from won.\n\n'Fools! The cursed beast is still out there!' Your words cut through their revelry, and the group falls silent, sobered by the realization that the hunt must continue. You set off to follow the trail it left behind, but your efforts yield nothing.\n\nThe direwolf has cunningly concealed its tracks as it fled. It’s clever—perhaps cleverer than you, and certainly more so than your party."
  wolf_invader.0061.a:0 "Now we'll have to track him all over again!"

  wolf_invader.0062.title:0 "Continued Consequences"
  wolf_invader.0062.desc:0 "After your failed hunt, it was only a matter of time before the direwolf resumed its murderous rampage. The question now looms--what will you do? Venture out once more to face the beast yourself, or hire another to take up the perilous task in your stead?"
  wolf_invader.0062.a:0 "Even if it takes ten thousand years, I will kill it!"
  wolf_invader.0062.b:0 "I've grown tired of dealing with this vile thing. Let's hire someone"

  wolf_invader.0071.title:0 "Skirmish in the Woods - Hunt Abandoned"
  wolf_invader.0071.desc:0 "You feel the Direwolf’s heart—fear mingled with defiance, a spark of life that pleads for freedom. Your mind brushes against its own, and in that fleeting bond, you see no malice, only survival.\n\nYou raise a hand, commanding the hunt to halt. 'Let it go,' you declare, your voice firm. The Direwolf bounds into the shadows, vanishing as swiftly as it appeared. But your courtiers’ faces darken—grumbles of wasted effort and unchallenged danger rise among them.\n\n'My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|U], that beast will haunt these lands yet,' one mutters, his grip tight on his spear. Your mercy has spared a life, but at the cost of their trust."

To your surprise, it shows no hostility. Its gaze lingers on you for a moment before it turns and pads away, as if beckoning you to follow.\n\nTrailing a direwolf might not be the wisest choice, yet if it meant you harm, surely it would have struck by now."
  wolf_invader.008.a:0 "I wonder what he wants"

  wolf_invader.0081.title:0 "Clarity"
  wolf_invader.0081.desc:0 "As you follow the direwolf, a strange affinity begins to stir within you. Your Warg abilities awaken, forging a deep connection with the creature. By the time you reach its den, you understand the direwolf with striking clarity.\n\nFirst, you realize he is a she—and she has led you here seeking a haven to raise her cubs. Through your bond, she reveals that her former realm was a place of peril, unfit for her young. When a portal opened, she seized her chance to escape.\nUpon arriving, she claimed this forest as her den. Her attacks on people were not mindless savagery but a desperate attempt to secure the surrounding lands, ensuring safety for herself and her cubs. When you spared her life long ago, she began to see that bloodshed would not fulfill her aims.\nSensing your Warg nature, she studied you, recognizing you as her greatest hope for survival. Now, bound to her through your Warg gifts, you share a tie that surpasses mere companionship. She pledges to stand by your side, provided you swear to protect her and her cubs."

  wolf_invader.0082.title:0 "The Den"
  wolf_invader.0082.desc:0 "The direwolf guides you to its den, slipping inside before turning to beckon you with a pleading gaze.\n\nStepping in, you see a resting area where a few cubs lie sprawled. It dawns on you that he is, in truth, a she.\n\nNow you grasp why the direwolf lashed out at people—she was shielding her family. She nudges a cub toward you with her muzzle, placing it gently at your feet. She intends for you to take it.\n\nRefusing hardly feels like an option—especially when she looks at you with such disarming charm.\n\nAs the direwolf and her remaining cubs depart the den, she offers you a solemn nod, a gesture of quiet respect. They turn toward the portal, their steps purposeful, likely bound for a final departure."

  wolf_invader.0084.title:0 "Riders of Monsters"
  wolf_invader.0084.desc:0 "Years have passed since you spared the direwolf pups, granting them sanctuary in the shadowed forests of your realm. Word now reaches you of their growth—where once small cubs roamed, mighty direwolves now stalk, their howls echoing through the wilds.\n\nYour people, long adept at taming wolves to serve as mounts in battle, have turned their craft to these greater beasts. In a clearing near your keep, you witness the fruit of their labor: warriors astride direwolves, their massive forms rippling with power, fangs bared and eyes agleam.\nThe trainers report success—the direwolves, fierce yet loyal, can be ridden into war, their speed and terror unmatched. Your marshal steps forward, pride in his voice. 'My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|U], with these direwolf Riders, our foes will tremble before our charge.'\n\nA new strength dawns for your armies.

  wolf_invader.0086.title:0 "The Call of the Wild"
  wolf_invader.0086.desc:0 "Your Direwolf, once a trembling pup cradled in your arms, now towers beside you, its fur thick and eyes sharp with the weight of maturity. As a Warg, you’ve shared its heart through countless days, but today, a restless pulse surges within it—an overwhelming urge to flee to the wilds.\n\nThrough your bond, you sense its longing—a primal call, fierce and untamed, pulling it toward the forest’s depths. The reason eludes you, yet the instinct burns fierce, a fire in its soul you cannot ignore.\n\nYour Direwolf paces, its gaze flickering between you and the horizon. In this quiet moment, it’s just you and your companion, bound by years of trust. Will you release it to heed its heart’s cry, or keep it by your side, defying the wild’s summons?"
  wolf_invader.0086.a:0 "I must... let you go..."

  wolf_invader.0087.title:0 "The Return of the Pack"
  wolf_invader.0087.desc:0 "Years have passed since you loosed your Direwolf to chase its wild heart, its absence a quiet ache in your own. Today, as you wander the shadowed woods of your realm, a familiar presence stirs your Warg senses—a low howl, rich with memory.\n\nFrom the undergrowth steps your old companion, its pelt streaked with age but its eyes still bright. Beside it stands another Direwolf, sleek and fierce, its scent foreign—surely a stranger slipped through the grand portal unseen. Trailing them is a litter of pups, tumbling over one another with eager yips.\n\nYour Direwolf nuzzles you briefly, a fleeting reunion that speaks of loyalty unbroken. Yet, as it turns to its mate and young, you feel the truth: the wilderness claims it now. The pack melts back into the forest, leaving you to ponder the peasantry’s unease at their new Direwolf neighbors—a brood that may grow as bold as their sire."

  wolf_invader.98.a:0 "Time to meet your maker you foul beast!" 

  wolf_invader.99.title:0 "Predator vs Prey"
  wolf_invader.99.desc:0 "You and your party hurl yourselves into a brutal struggle against the direwolf, striking in unison with coordinated assaults, striving to overwhelm and bring it down.\n\nThe direwolf, undaunted, proves a relentless foe—deftly evading your blows, it seeks to divide your ranks and pick you off one by one.\n\nNone can say who will emerge from this deadly clash alive."
  wolf_invader.99.a:0 "We shall prevail!"

  wolf_invader.100.title:0 "Last Howls"
  wolf_invader.100.desc:0 "The battle rages fiercely. The direwolf strives to isolate you, seeking to fight you one by one and cut you down, but your party holds fast, refusing to be divided. Despite its hulking size, the beast is astonishingly nimble, dodging most of your strikes and suffering only shallow wounds. Yet, in a fleeting moment, it falters. You and your companions seize the chance, cornering it with ruthless precision. Together, you leap upon it in a relentless onslaught, leaving it no hope of defense.\n\nThe direwolf lets out a final, mournful howl—and falls lifeless.\n\nYou and your party turn to one another, breathless, ensuring none bear mortal wounds."

  wolf_invader.101.title:0 "Spoils to the Victors"
  wolf_invader.101.desc:0 "Gazing upon the lifeless form of the direwolf, you muse that its head would adorn your courtroom splendidly. You might have claimed its pelt as well, were it not mangled beyond recognition.\n\nFor now, you and your party take respite, swelling with pride that the fearsome beast which once plagued these lands lies dead—felled by your own hands.\n\nAs night draws near, a thought stirs: the direwolf surely had a den nearby. That lair might yet harbor dangers and must be sought out swiftly."
  
  wolf_invader.101.a:0 "Hail to the Wolf Slayers!"
  wolf_invader.102.title:0 "Wolfslayer"
  wolf_invader.102.desc:0 "You and the direwolf are entwined in a savage duel, locked in a struggle of wills. Your hunting party stands back, watching in awe as you clash with relentless fury. The direwolf proves a masterful foe, nimbly evading your strikes while landing vicious blows of its own.\n\nThe fight has strayed far from where it began, weaving through trees and creeks, past boulders and bushes.\n\nBoth of you draw ragged breaths, each searching for an opening to end this grueling contest. With a final surge of strength, the direwolf lunges at you, but you seize the moment, driving your sword deep into its throat as it closes in.\n\nA wild whimper escapes the direwolf as it collapses to the earth."
  wolf_invader.102.a:0 "Victory is MINE!"

  wolf_invader.103.title:0 "Aftermath"
  wolf_invader.103.desc:0 "After your triumphant victory, exhaustion sets in, and you resolve to rest. You kindle a campfire in a nearby clearing.\n\nAs you ponder what to cook for your meal, curiosity stirs—how might direwolf taste? While butchering the beast for meat, you carefully strip its pelt, envisioning it as a trophy for your courtroom.\n\nAs night falls, a thought gnaws at you: the direwolf must have had a lair. What if other direwolves lurk there? Or perhaps it concealed something valuable within its den?\n\nYou resolve to investigate at first light tomorrow."

  wolf_invader.104.title:0 "The Den"
  wolf_invader.104.desc:0 "After days of scouring the wilderness, you at last uncover the direwolf’s den—a cave nestled into a mountainside, its entrance veiled by the rugged terrain. Steeling yourself, you venture inside alone.\n\nAs you step in, you’re struck by the unexpected orderliness; the direwolf maintained a tidy lair. Deeper within, faint, high-pitched howls echo through the shadows—another direwolf, perhaps? Moments later, you find the source--not a fearsome beast, but a lone pup. Glancing around, you spot the small, lifeless bodies of other direwolf cubs, their frail forms withered from starvation in their parent’s absence. This one, barely clinging to life, is the sole survivor.\n\nThe choice is yours: take the pup and raise it as your loyal companion, or slay it, purging these lands of direwolves forever."

The direwolf sinks its fangs into your throat, and from that mortal wound, there is no return.\n\nAs your life ebbs away, blood pooling beneath you, you catch a final glimpse of the direwolf charging after your fleeing party.
