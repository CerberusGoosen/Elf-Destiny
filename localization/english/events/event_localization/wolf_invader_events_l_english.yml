  wolf_invader.0001.title:0 "Strange Reports"
  wolf_invader.0001.desc:0 "As you walk into your council hall to go about the usual interests of the day one of your councillors informs you of a strange occurrence near the portal gate, "My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], it appears that something or someone has has caused significant disruption to the portal gate" another councillor offers an opinion, "No doubt some unruly children." of course, it wouldn't be a council meeting without your Aeluran Advisor barging into the conversation "My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], children cannot cause such destruction. besides, this is Sacrilege!" She says with a authoritative voice.\n"As Realm [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|U] it is your duty to protect such a sacred place that connects our worlds together!"\n\nPondering for a minute, you decide to visit the gate to see what happened there. Upon arrival you find it in a messy state. trees torn up, shrines broken, fences destroyed. Large clawmarks and strings of heavy fur cover the area. Whatever tore this place up is either a madman, a madelf, or a vicious beast. Whatever this thing is, it must be stopped."
  
  wolf_invader.0001.a:0 "We must find this creature!"

  wolf_invader.0002.title:0 "Direwolf Sighted"
  wolf_invader.0002.desc:0 ""They found a what now?!" "A Direwolf, my [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|U]! Some peasants were ambushed by it in the forest. Soldiers sent to investigate were themselves set upon by it. The survivors swearing it was a Direwolf. Mayhaps it's the same creature that desecrated the portal gate!" You find out this council meeting won't be as smooth as you hoped. "Don't be ridiculous!" Says another councillor, "A Direwolf? from a children's story? What's next? Giants?" This of course doesn't got unchallenged. "And I suppose you have a better idea of what could cause such a mess?"\n\nThe countryside has been terrorized in the last few days. Dead animals torn to shreds, people disappearing, strange and large claw marks, same as the ones near the portal gate. It all makes sense. But why would a Direwolf come here of all places? what does it have to seek here? Regardless a decision must be made soon"

  wolf_invader.0002.a:0 "Spread the word, there's a Direwolf running around."

  wolf_invader.0003.title:0 "Destruction with No End"
  wolf_invader.0003.desc:0 "Caravans, Patrols, Merchants, This Direwolf is preying on weak targets in the midst of darkness, killing and eating anyone foolish enough to travel in a small group. He even destroyed a local whorehouse! Needless to say this is causing a significant effect on our economy. Less trade, less bartering, less taxes. This Direwolf is causing a mess and needs to be dealt with. Your council starts floating ideas\n\n"He should be hunted down, and defeated! Our good and brave [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|U] Shall dispatch this vicious creature!"\n"Gold is an excellent incentive! Let's hire someone, or several someones"\n"Perhaps if we leave it alone will go of it's own volition?" This, of course sends the rest of your council into fury. But you pay them no heed. instead, you ponder on what you should do."
  
  wolf_invader.0003.a:0 "Maybe it will leave if we let it be?"
  wolf_invader.0003.b:0 "Call my Knights! It's time for a hunt!"
  wolf_invader.0003.c:0 "Let's hire someone foolish enough to hunt this beast!"

  wolf_invader.00031.title:0 "Timely Arrival"
  wolf_invader.00031.desc:0 "The castle is full of activity, many would be Direwolf slayers have arrived with the intent of slaying the wolf, getting paid, and earning glory for themselves. People from all walks of life have assembled in your courtyard. Young men, men at arms, experienced killers, sellswords, thugs, you even manage to spot a pirate in there. whomever it is you hire will have the difficult task of finding and killing a most vicious and deadly beast."
  
  wolf_invader.00031.a:0 "Let's hire the cheapest ones"
  wolf_invader.00031.b:0 "Capable and Affordable is what we need"
  wolf_invader.00031.c:0 "No compromise, Only the best will do"

  wolf_invader.00032.title:0 "The Mercenaries Succeed"
  wolf_invader.00032.desc:0 "Rumors and gossip spread throughout the castle, the mercenaries you hired have rode through the gates with a thick, large and bloody sack on a cart. As they enter the throne room, prize in tow, you look at them with a pleasant curiosity.\n\n"It's done my [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|U]" The head mercenary says, the vile beast is dead. He pulls the cover off and shows you the absurdly large head of the Direwolf. It's a grotesque view; mangled and bloody.\n\n You throw them a large feast and you all spend the evening celebrating. laughing, and raising toasts to the brave men.\n\nAs the mercenaries leave you can't help but wonder what was the goal of this creature, and what it wanted in your lands. Mayhaps you'll never know."
  
  wolf_invader.00032.a:0 "Back to Normal"


  wolf_invader.00033.title:0 "Still Howling"
  wolf_invader.00033.desc:0 "Seems like the mercenaries you hired weren't capable of killing the Direwolf. Your councillor approaches you and informs you that the mercenaries you hired have been found by the local peasants mangled and eaten. The Direwolf is still out there, still terrorizing the countryside. There's no telling what he will do next now that he's been aggravated like this."
  
  wolf_invader.00033.a:0 "Will no one rid me of this meddlesome beast?"


  wolf_invader.0004.title:0 "Wolfslayer"
  wolf_invader.0004.desc:0 "Your inaction towards the Direwolf hasn't been received well by the people of the county. Some have taken it upon themselves to rid the lands of this creature. Many tried, and many died. But one succeeded where all failed.\n\n[wolfslayer.GetFirstName] presents you with the head of the beast. It's smaller than you thought, nowhere near as fearsome as the legends will lead you to believe. But then again who really knows how big a Direwolf ought to be? Regardless the creature is dead, and it shall not terrorize anyone else."
  
  wolf_invader.0004.a:0 "Still, Is It Really Dead?"



  wolf_invader.00041.title:0 "Howling Once More"
  wolf_invader.00041.desc:0 "You knew it! You had a feeling that [wolfslayer.GetFirstName] didn't kill the Direwolf! The accursed thing is back yet again and it's terrorizing the countryside once more. Peasants are hiding in their homes and trade is decreasing steadily. it is clear this thing can no longer be ignored, it must be dealt with."

  wolf_invader.00041.a:0 "I'm going to kill this damn creature myself!"
  wolf_invader.00041.b:0 "We have gold, let's pay someone to deal with this"


  wolf_invader.0005.title:0 "Out Hunting"
  wolf_invader.0005.desc:0 "I've assembled a capable party of hunters and warriors to accompany me to the hunt. Small enough so that we can draw out the Direwolf, yet large enough to stand a chance against against the beast. Over the next few days we will scour the woods and wilderness, the vile thing will not escape us!"
  
  wolf_invader.0005.a:0 "Let's go kill him!"


  wolf_invader.0006.title:0 "Standoff"
  wolf_invader.0006.desc:0 "You've been out here for days searching for the Direwolf with no success. Maybe it left your lands? You decide to take a brake from hunting and set up a campfire, nothing too big as to not attract attention. Soon though, you and your party hear a noise. You turn around to face it, but see nothing. Then you hear a growl. It's here, watching you, waiting for you to make some mistake.\n\nSoon enough, it reveals itself, you and your party stare it down. Each waiting for the other to make a move."
  
  wolf_invader.0006.a:0 "Get Him!"

  wolf_invader.0061.title:0 "Swing and a Miss"
  wolf_invader.0061.desc:0 "You run at the wolf, trying to engage it. However, before you can hit it, it runs away deep into the forest. Your party cheers on but you know better than to celebrate.\n\n"Fools! the damn thing is still out there!" Your party quickly quiets down, realizing they will have to track it again. You begin to follow the trail it left behind, but to no avail.\n\nThe Direwolf expertly hid his trail as he was running away. He's smart, maybe smarter than you. No doubt smarter than your party."
  
  wolf_invader.0061.a:0 "Now we'll have to track him all over again!"

  wolf_invader.0062.title:0 "Consequences"
  wolf_invader.0062.desc:0 "After your failed hunt it was only a matter of time until the Direwolf returned to his murder spree. The question is, now what? Do you go out again? Or do you hire someone else to do the work for you?"
  
  wolf_invader.0062.a:0 "Even if it takes Ten Thousand Years, I will kill it!"
  wolf_invader.0062.b:0 "I've grown tired of dealing with this vile thing. Let's hire someone"

  wolf_invader.0007.title:0 "Skirmish in the Woods"
  wolf_invader.0007.desc:0 "You and your party enter into a clearing and the Direwolf soon follows in. You start circling each other seeing who will make the first move. You try to figure out some form of a strategy to bring this thing down"
  
  wolf_invader.0007.a:0 "Back away slowly and let him go"
  wolf_invader.0007.b:0 "Charge with me!"
  wolf_invader.0007.c:0 "I'm going to duel him"


 wolf_invader.0008.title:0 "A Peaceful Encounter"
 wolf_invader.0008.desc:0 "As you go for a walk through the forest, you hear sounds of walking behind you.\n\nYou turn around to face them and see none other that the same Direwolf you let go sometime ago. The Direwolf isn't showing any signs of hostility towards you. It looks at you and begins walking away, almost wanting you to follow it.\n\nMaybe following a Direwolf around isn't a bright idea but if it wanted to kill you it could've tried to already."

 
 wolf_invader.0008.a:0 "I wonder what he wants"


 wolf_invader.00081.title:0 "Clarity"
 wolf_invader.00081.desc:0 "Following the Direwolf, you begin to feel a connection to it. Your Warg abilities allowed you to connect to the Direwolf on a deeper level. By the time you reach the Den you understand the Direwolf much more clearly.\n\nFirst off, He is a She, and She has come here wanting a safer place to raise her cubs. She tells you her previous world wasn't safe for her, and that when the portal opened up, she saw her chance and took it.\n\nAfter she arrived here she established a Den in this forest. She was attacking people with the intent of clearing the area around the forest to make sure her and her cubs were safe. When you let her go sometime ago in this forest she understood that her goals wouldn't be achieved through killing.\n\nSensing that you're a warg she begun to study you, understanding that you're the best chance for survival she has. Since you've connected to her as a warg, you have a bond with her that transcends normal friendship. She promises to accompany you so long as you guarantee her and her cubs' safety."
 
 wolf_invader.00081.a:0 "A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one"


 wolf_invader.00082.title:0 "The Den"
 wolf_invader.00082.desc:0 "The Direwolf leads you to his den. He goes inside and begs you to follow.\n\nGoing in you spot a resting area and a some cubs laying on it. He is in fact a She.\n\nYou start to understand why the Direwolf was attacking people, She was trying to protect her family. The Direwolf Picks up a cob and places it next to you. She wants YOU to have it.\n\nSaying no isn't exactly an option. He also looks very cute.\n\nAs the Direwolf and her remaining cubs leave the den she gives you a nod, almost like a sign of respect. They begin heading in the direction of the portal, most likely with the intent of leaving for good"
