  wolf_invader.0001.title:0 "Strange Reports"
  wolf_invader.0001.desc:0 "As you walk into your council hall to go about the usual interests of the day one of your councilors informs you of a strange occurrence near the portal gate, "My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], it appears that something or someone has has caused significant disruption to the portal gate" "No doubt some unruly children." says a different councilor. of course, it wouldn't be a council meeting without your Aeluran advisor barging into the conversation "My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord] this is Sacrilege!" She says with a determined and authoritative voice. "As Realm [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|U] it is your duty to protect such a sacred place that connects our worlds together!" pondering for a minute, you decide to visit the gate to see what happened there. Upon arrival you find it in a messy state. trees torn up, shrines broken, fences destroyed. Large clawmarks and strings of heavy fur cover the area. Whatever tore this place up is either a madman, a madelf, or a vicious beast. Whatever this thing is, it must be stopped."
  
  wolf_invader.0001.a:0 "We must find this creature!"

  wolf_invader.0002.title:0 "Direwolf Sighted"
  wolf_invader.0002.desc:0 "They found a what now ?! "A Direwolf, my [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|U]! Mayhaps the very same that desecrated the portal gate!" You find out this council meeting won't be as smooth as you hoped. "Don't be Ridiculous!" Says another counciler, "A Direwolf ? from a children's story ? What's next ? Giants?" This of course doesn't got unchallanged. "And i suppose you have a better idea of what could cause such a mess ?" the countryside has been terrorized in the last few days. Dead animals, turn to shreds, people disappearing, strange and large clawmarks, same as the ones near the portal gate. It all makes sense. But why would a Direwolf come here of all places ? what does it have to seek here ? Regardless a decision must be made soon"

  wolf_invader.0002.a:0 "Spread the word, there's a Direwolf running around."

  wolf_invader.0003.title:0 "Destruction with No End"
  wolf_invader.0003.desc:0 "Caravans, Patrols, Merchants, This Direwolf is preying on weak targets in the midst of darkness, killing and eating everyone who is foolish enough to travel in a small group. He even destroyed a whorehouse or two! Needless to say this is causing a significant effect on our economy. Less trade, less bartering, less taxes. This Direwolf is causing a mess and needs to be dealt with. your peasants are already clamoring for action. Your council starts floating ideas, "He should be hunted down, and defeated!" "But who will be brave enough to face such a vicious creature!" "Gold is an excellent incentive! Let's hire someone, or several someones" "Our good and brave [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|U] Shall dispatch this vicious creature!" "Perhaps if we leave it alone will go of it's own volition?" This, of course sends the rest of your council into fury. But you pay them no heed. instead, you ponder on what you should do."
  
  wolf_invader.0003.a:0 "Maybe it really will leave if we just let it ?"
  wolf_invader.0003.b:0 "Call my Knights! It's time for a Hunt!"
  wolf_invader.0003.c:0 "Let's hire someone foolish enough to Hunt this beast!"

  wolf_invader.00031.title:0 "Timely Arrival"
  wolf_invader.00031.desc:0 "The castle is full of activity, many would be Direwolf slayers have arrived with the intent of slaying the wolf, getting paid, and earning glory for themselves. People from all walks of life have assembled in your courtyard. Young men, men at arms, experienced killers, sellswords, thugs, you even manage to spot a pirate in there. whomever it is you hire will have the difficult task of finding and killing a most vicious and deadly beast."
  
  wolf_invader.00031.a:0 "Let's hire the cheapest ones"
  wolf_invader.00031.b:0 "Capable and Affordable is what we need"
  wolf_invader.00031.c:0 "No compromise, Only the best will do"

  wolf_invader.00032.title:0 "The Mercenaries Succeed"
  wolf_invader.00032.desc:0 "Rumors and gossip spread throughout the castle, the mercenaries you hired have rode through the gates with a thick, bloody sack in their hands. When they enter the throne room you look at them with a pleasant curiosity. "It's done my [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|U]" The head mercenary says, the vile beast is dead. he pulls out the head of the beast from the bloody sack and presents it to you. It's a grotesque view, the Direwolf's head is a mangled and bloody thing. As the mercenaries leave you can't help but wonder what was the goal of this creature, and what it wanted in your lands. Mayhaps you'll never know."
  
  wolf_invader.00032.a:0 "Back to Normal"


  wolf_invader.00033.title:0 "Still Howling"
  wolf_invader.00033.desc:0 "Seems like the mercenaries you hired weren't capable of killing the Direwolf. Your councilor approaches you and informs you that the mercenaries you hired have been found by the local peasants mangled and eaten. The Direwolf is still out there, still terrorizing the countryside. There's no telling what he will do next now that he's been aggravated like this."
  
  wolf_invader.00033.a:0 "Will no one rid me of this Meddlesome Beast ?"

  wolf_invader.0004.title:0 "Wolfslayer"
  wolf_invader.0004.desc:0 "Your inaction towards the Direwolf hasn't been received well by the people of the county. some have taken it upon themselves to rid the place of this creature. Many tried, and many died. But one succeeded where all failed. [wolfslayer.GetFirstName] presents you with the head of the beast. It's smaller thant you thought, no where near as fearsome as a Direwolf is supposed to be. But then again who really knows how big a Direwolf is ought be ? Regardless the creature is dead, and it shall not terrorize anyone else."
  
  wolf_invader.0004.a:0 "Still, Is It Really Dead ?"

  wolf_invader.00041.title:0 "Howling Once More"
  wolf_invader.00041.desc:0 "You knew it ! You had a feeling that [wolfslayer.GetFirstName] didn't kill the Direwolf ! The accursed thing is back yet again and it's terrorizing the countryside once more. Peasants are once again hiding in their homes and trade is decreasing steadily. it's clear this thing can no longer be ignored, it must be dealt with."

  wolf_invader.00041.a:0 "I'm going to kill this damn creature myself !"
  wolf_invader.00041.b:0 "We have gold, let's pay someone to deal with this"


  wolf_invader.0005.title:0 "Out Hunting"
  wolf_invader.0005.desc:0 "I've assembled a capable party of hunters and warriors to accompany me to the hunt. Nothing too big, so that we can draw out the Direwolf, yet big enough to stand a chance. Over the next few days we will scour the woods and wilderness, the vile thing will not escape us !"
  
  wolf_invader.0005.a:0 "Let's go kill him !"
#
#
  wolf_invader.0006.title:0 "Standoff"
  wolf_invader.0006.desc:0 "You've been out here for days searching for the Direwolf, you start to feel as if it's not even here anymore. Soon though, you and your party hear a noise, you turn around to face it, but see nothing. Then you hear a growl. It's here, watching you, waiting for you to make some mistake. Soon it reveals itself, you and your party stare it down. Each waiting for the other to make a move."
  
  wolf_invader.0006.a:0 "Get Him !"
#

  wolf_invader.0061.title:0 "Swing and a Miss"
  wolf_invader.0061.desc:0 "You run at the wolf, trying to engage it, but before you can hit it, it runs away deep into the forest. Your party cheers on but you know better than to celebrate. "Fools ! the damn thing is this out there !" Your party quickly quiets down, realizing they will have to track it again. You begin to follow the trail it left behind, but to no avail. The Direwolf expertly hid his trail as he was running away. He's smart, maybe smarter than you. No doubt smarter than your party."
  
  wolf_invader.0061.a:0 "Now we'll have to track him all over again !"
#
#
  wolf_invader.0062.title:0 "Consequences"
  wolf_invader.0062.desc:0 "After your failed hunt it was only a matter of time until the Direwolf returned to his murder spree. The question is, now what ? Do you go out again ? or do you hire someone else to do the work for you ?"
  
  wolf_invader.0062.a:0 "Even if it takes Ten Thousand Years, I will kill it !"
  wolf_invader.0062.b:0 "I've grown tired of dealing with this vile thing. Let's hire someone"

  wolf_invader.0007.desc:0 "You and your party enter into a clearing and the Direwolf soon follows in. You start circling each other seeing who will make the first move. You try to figure out some form of a strategy to bring this thing down"
  
  wolf_invader.0007.a:0 "Back away slowly and let him go"
  wolf_invader.0007.b:0 "Charge with me!"
  wolf_invader.0007.c:0 "I'm going to duel him"
