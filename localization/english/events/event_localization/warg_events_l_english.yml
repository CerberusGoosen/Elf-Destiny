  warg.001.title:0 "An Awakened Bond"
  warg.001.desc.standard:0 "As you wander the wooded glade near your keep, your faithful hound bounds alongside you, chasing shadows in the undergrowth. The air is still, the world serene—until a strange sensation stirs within you.\n\nYour vision blurs, and for a fleeting moment, you see not through your own eyes, but through your hound’s. The forest unfolds in sharp scents and vivid hues, the rustle of leaves deafening in your ears. You feel its heartbeat, its instincts, entwined with your own.\n\nWhen your sight returns, you stagger, breathless. The hound gazes up at you, its eyes glinting with an unspoken bond. You’ve become something more—a Warg, gifted with the power to meld your soul with a beast’s."

  warg.001.desc.bird:0 "You sit by the crackling hearth in your hall, your loyal falcon perched nearby, preening its feathers. Idly, you toss it a scrap of meat, watching as it snaps it up with precision. Then, without warning, a shiver courses through you.\n\nYour mind reels as your senses shift—suddenly, you’re peering through the falcon’s keen eyes, the room a dizzying swirl of heat and motion. You feel the weight of its wings, the rush of air as it tilts its head. Your thoughts brush against its own, fierce and wild, yet tethered to you.\n\nThe trance breaks, and you gasp, staring at the bird. It meets your gaze, unblinking, as if it knows. A power awakens within you: the gift of the Warg, to see and command through the eyes of beasts."

[recipient.GetNamePossessive] court brims with secrets, ripe for the taking—if only you could peer beyond its walls. With a thought, you consider the beasts at your command, pondering which shall serve as your spies.\nA flock of birds could take wing, swift and silent, their keen eyes sweeping over ramparts and courtyards. They excel at spotting movements from afar—guards on patrol, banners raised in haste—though whispers behind closed doors might elude their grasp.\nOr perhaps a band of rats, stealthy and small, could creep through the shadows of [recipient.GetNamePossessive] halls. Their ears catch hushed plots and their noses sniff out hidden troves, though they risk being noticed by a sharp-eyed servant or a hungry cat.\nThe choice is yours: will you send the #BOL birds#! aloft or loose the #BOL rats#! into the dark?"

  warg.0021.desc.affair.bird:0 "With a whisper of will, your flock of birds takes flight, their wings cutting through the sky toward [recipient.GetNamePossessive] holding. You meld with their senses, the world below sharpening into a vivid mosaic of stone and soil.\n\nPerched atop the gnarled branches of an ancient oak near the keep’s outer walls, they survey the grounds. Guards march along the ramparts, oblivious, while a stablehand tends to restless steeds. Then, a flicker of movement catches their eyes—a clandestine meeting unfolds in the shadow of the holdfast’s garden.\nThere, beneath a canopy of vines, [secret_target.GetName] steals a fleeting embrace with [affair_target.GetName], their hushed laughter betraying a forbidden passion. The birds tilt their heads, capturing every glance and whispered vow, their keen sight unmasking the affair.\nAs they return to you, the secret settles in your mind: [secret_target.GetName] and [affair_target.GetName] are entwined in a tryst, a scandal ripe for your schemes."
  warg.0021.desc.murder.bird:0 "You summon your Warg powers, sending your flock of birds aloft toward [recipient.GetNamePossessive] holding. Their wings beat against the wind as you slip into their senses, the landscape below unfurling in stark clarity. They alight upon the weathered eaves of a watchtower near the keep, their sharp eyes scanning the grounds. A servant hauls water from a well, and a sentry yawns at his post—then, a sudden stir draws their gaze to a secluded corner of the courtyard.\nThere, beneath the looming shadow of the holdfast’s walls, [secret_target.GetName] stands over [murder_target.GetName], a blade flashing in the dim light. A muffled cry escapes as [murder_target.GetName] crumples to the earth, blood pooling beneath them. [secret_target.GetName], breath ragged, wipes the dagger clean and casts a furtive glance around, unaware of the silent witnesses above.\nThe birds return, their minds heavy with the grim sight. You now hold a deadly secret: [secret_target.GetName] has slain [murder_target.GetName], a truth that could shatter or serve you, depending on your will."
  warg.0021.desc.embezzle.bird:0 "You call upon your Warg gifts, dispatching your flock of birds to soar over [recipient.GetName] holding. Their wings slice through the air as you meld with their senses, the keep’s sprawl sharpening into focus below.\nThey settle atop the crumbling ledge of a storehouse near the holdfast, their piercing gaze sweeping the surroundings. A cart creaks under a load of grain, and a guard grumbles about the chill—then, their attention snaps to a flicker of lantern light in a shadowed alcove.\nThere, [secret_target.GetName] hunches over a chest, hands trembling as they slip gold coins into a concealed pouch. A ledger lies open beside them, its figures hastily altered to mask the theft. They mutter nervously, glancing toward the keep, blind to the feathered spies overhead.\n\nThe birds wing back to you, their vision etched with avarice unveiled. [secret_target.GetName] is pilfering gold from their liege [embezzled_lord.GetNamePossessive] coffers—a secret now yours to bend to your purpose."
  warg.0021.desc.religion.bird:0 "You call forth your Warg gifts, dispatching a flock of birds to glide over [recipient.GetNamePossessive] holding. Their wings carve the sky as you meld with their senses, the keep’s silhouette stark against the horizon.\n\nThey perch upon a narrow sill outside a high chamber window, their sharp eyes piercing the gloom within. A guard paces far below, but here, solitude reigns—until [secret_target.GetName] enters, barring the door behind [secret_target.GetHerHim].\n\nFrom beneath a loose stone in the floor, they unveil a hidden altar, its carvings strange and ancient. They kneel, lighting a taper and chanting softly, their voice rising in devotion to a faith the court would shun. The birds watch, unblinking, as the ritual unfolds in the flickering light.\n\nThe flock returns, their vision branded with blasphemy. [secret_target.GetName] practices a secret faith—a truth now yours to guard or expose."

  warg.0021.desc.affair.rat:0 "You summon your Warg powers, bending the minds of a skittering band of rats to your will. With a silent command, you send them scurrying across the borders into [recipient.GetNamePossessive] holding, their tiny forms slipping unseen through the cracks.\nThrough their senses, you creep along the keep’s underbelly: the damp reek of stone, the clatter of a servant’s broom, and the faint hum of voices overhead. They dart beneath a tapestry in the great hall, where a sliver of candlelight spills from a side chamber. There, in the flickering glow, [secret_target.GetName] and [affair_target.GetName] stand entwined, their lips brushing in a stolen kiss. A soft laugh escapes [affair_target.GetName] as [secret_target.GetName] murmurs words too low for human ears—but not for the rats, who catch every tender syllable.\nThe rats return, their minds bearing the weight of forbidden desire. [secret_target.GetName] and [affair_target.GetName] are lovers, a clandestine bond now laid bare for your schemes."
  warg.0021.desc.murder.rat:0 "You channel your Warg gifts, weaving your will into a band of rats that skitter forth from your domain. They slip across the borders into [recipient.GetNamePossessive] holding, their small forms vanishing into the shadows.\n\nThrough their senses, you prowl the keep’s hidden corners: the musty scent of old straw, the drip of water on stone, and the distant clink of armor. They scurry beneath a warped floorboard in the cellar, where a faint groan draws their twitching whiskers. There, in the dim glow of a single torch, [secret_target.GetName] looms over [murder_target.GetName], a knife plunging deep into flesh. [murder_target.GetName] gasps, a wet choke escaping as they slump against the cold wall, life draining away. [secret_target.GetName], panting, drags the body into the dark, oblivious to the rats’ gleaming eyes.\n\nThe rats return, their minds shadowed by death. [secret_target.GetName] has murdered [murder_target.GetName]—a bloody secret now yours to wield."

They scurry forth, crossing into [recipient.GetNamePossessive] holding, their tiny claws whispering against stone as they vanish into the gloom.\nThrough their senses, you slink through the keep’s underbelly: the tang of mold, the rustle of dust, and the faint jingle of metal. They squeeze beneath a loose plank in the steward’s quarters, where the scent of ink and coin draws them closer.\nThere, hunched over a cluttered desk, [secret_target.GetName] counts out gold from a strongbox, slipping a handful into a hidden satchel. Their quill scratches false sums onto a ledger, a bead of sweat betraying their guilt. They mutter a curse, unaware of the rats’ watchful eyes in the dark.\n\nThe rats return, their minds laden with greed’s proof. [secret_target.GetName] is siphoning gold from [embezzled_lord.GetNamePossessive] wealth—a secret now yours to twist to your ends."

Drawn by a whiff of incense, they dart under a heavy curtain into a private chamber, where a strange sight unfolds.\n\nThere, [secret_target.GetName] kneels before a concealed altar, its surface shrouded by a tapestry until now. They light a candle, murmuring fervent prayers in a tongue unfamiliar to the court, their hands tracing symbols of a forbidden creed. The rats’ keen ears catch every whispered vow, their eyes glinting in the dark.\n\nThe rats return, their minds steeped in heresy’s scent. [secret_target.GetName] harbors a secret faith—a revelation that could unmake them, should you choose to wield it."

But danger lurks. A shadow shifts, and a wiry rat catcher, broom in one hand and trap in the other, spots their furtive forms.\n\nA swift strike claims one, then a snare snaps shut on another. Their squeals flood your mind as your bond unravels, the survivors fleeing in disarray. The rat catcher grunts, pleased with his haul, unwitting that he’s foiled your scheme—leaving you with nothing but thwarted ambition."

The flock scatters in panic, the spying undone. The peasant, oblivious to your intent, gathers his quarry, leaving you with naught but frustration—and a lesson in the perils of chance."
